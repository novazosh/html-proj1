	For this project, team performance was lacking. Connor and Zosia were the only members to produce significant amounts of work on the project web site and presentation. Michael and Steven were absent or unable to contribute to the delegation and completion of website building, research organization, or presentation planning. Stronger team collaboration and communication would have been paramount more timely completion as well as even distribution of work. 
	The team members involved began working on the layout and navigation of the website before adding research and data vizualization sections. </p>
	<p>
	In the research and data visualization sections, data was gathered via survey and by looking up the social media accounts of a random group of popular food trucks to create charts and graphs. This research was then used to create a solution. Connor was in charge of coding the problem and solution portions of the website. Zosia completed the data visualization, research, and presentation pages of the website as well as organized the presentation. 
	To improve upon the organization of the group, we should have set weekly meetings and determined a group leader and universal group punishments for lack of completed work. 
	</p>
	<div class="title"><center><h2>Primary Research</h2></center></div>
	<p>
	Our team's primary research includes data about 15 popular food trucks' social media presence as well as a survery of social media users regarding their use of different services and food apps. 
	</p>
	<p>
	<h3>Popular Food Truck Data</h3>
	The following source was used to compile a random list of 15 popular Food Trucks: <a href="https://www.thedailymeal.com/travel/slideshow-101-best-food-trucks-america-2017"> The Daily Meal Slideshow </a></p>
	<p>
	The social media accounts of each site were visited on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to record the number of page/account followers, number of hashtag mentions, number of posts, and number of page likes. This data was then entered into the following database:
		<a href="FinalDatabase.accdb">Food Truck Database</a>
	</p>
	<p>The Food trucks chosen include:
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Mac Mart Truck (Philadelphia, PA)</li>
	</br>
	<li>Grilled Cheeserie (Nashville TN)</li></br>
	<li>The Taco Truck (Hoboken, NJ)</li></br>
	<li>Fukuburger Truck (Las Vegas, NV)</li></br>
	<li>Luke's Lobster (New York City, NY)</li></br>
	<li>The Cow and Curd (Philadelphia, PA)</li></br>
	<li>Kogi BBQ (Los Angeles, CA)</li></br>
	<li>Ms. Cheezious (Miami, FL)</li></br>
	<li>Cinnamon Snail (NYC, NY)</li></br>
	<li>Oink & Moo BBQ (Florham Park, NJ)</li></br>
	<li>Aloha Plate (Honolulu, HI)</li></br>
	<li>Babycakes (Chicago, IL)</li></br>

	<li>The Bacon Truck (Boston, MA)</li></br>
	<li>East Side King (Austin,TX)</li></br>
	</ol>
	<p>The data from these food trucks was used to determine the current social media strategies of successful trucks. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Social Media Use Survey</h3>
	<p>
	Google Forms was used to create a survey asking which social media sites and food apps were used by individuals and at what rate. The survey can be found <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/rjDJoBuA1W6PKZxC2">here</a>. Data collected was then downloaded to a google sheet where it was used to determine which sites are predominantly used.

	<div class="title"><center><h2>Secondary Research</h2></center>
	</div>
	<div class="sr">
	Our teams's secondary research includes a research paper titled <i>The food truck phenomenon: A successful blend of PR and social media-ProQuest </i> by Noelle Ibrahim, and three additional articles about food truck business logistics and social media strategy. A fifth source includes a paper titled <i>Social Media: Multiple Channels to Capture Multiple Audiences</i> by Katherine L. Derby from the IU ACM library. 
	<ol>
	<li>
	<b>Source:</b> Ibrahim, N. <i>The food truck phenomenon: A successful blend of PR and social media-ProQuest</i> </br>
	<b>Summary:</b> This paper helps explain the emergence of food trucks as an industry which uses social media as a marketing tool. By taking advantage of social media, food trucks have been able to attract and engage consumers who are on-the-go but have access to various connected devices. </br>
	<b>Use:</b>This article determines the usefulness of social media in solving the problems faced by food truck owners. Because they do not have set locations, their dependency on social media makes for customer connection without need for a brick and mortar storefront. 
	</li></br>
	<li>
	<b>Source:</b> Florida, R.  <i>5 Secrets of Food Truck Location</i> </br>
	<b>Summary:</b> This article explains the power of Twitter, noting that often the popularity and location of food trucks is determined through social media and user postings. The power of technology in general is noted, explaining that those with access to technology have a easier time tracking food truck location and actually eating. With that, the article noted the importance of location, explaining that the majority of food truck sales occured in very few areas. This means that location is a huge factor in sales. The article also highlighted that presence of food trucks in general can increase the amount a family spends on eating out. Because they are able to visit various locations, food trucks also provide service in spaces which lack traditional restaurants yet have high demand potential. 
	</br>
	<b>Use:</b>	The article noted that the location of food trucks can often be hard to determine, especially when one does not have access to technology. This is a problem we seek to solve in our project. We seek to create a mobile platform that food trucks and consumers can connect through. By creating a application we can allow food trucks to post their location and for users to receive instant feedback on location and even give them a chance to post their suggestions. As highlighted in the article we see the powerful relationship between technology and location.

	<b>Source:</b> Restaurant MBA <i>Food Truck Loyalty: Rewards that Benefit the Customer & the Business</i> </br>
	<b>Summary:</b> In this article, the author explains that the basic functions of a loyalty program are to “thank, reward, and entice dedicated customers”(Restaurant MBA). They should also provide the food truck owners with insights into consumer patterns in spending and frequency of visit. In this way, a well-made loyalty program benefits both customer and food truck owner. The article continues to describe the method of a punch-card loyalty program where customers are rewarded after a certain number of purchases or points. It also points out the need for a modern style so that users will not forget that they have the punch-card system. We will implement this punch card system in our app by coding an approachable and user-friendly app. By allowing users to have constant access to their loyalty system via their mobile phone, they are less likely to forget about its existence when looking for or visiting the food truck.
	A second useful point made in the article is that many people only use “one or two” of the many loyalty programs that they are members of. This issue can be caused by providing a user-friendly customer focused design to a mobile loyalty system. If a customer can understand what they will receive, they are more likely to use the system to their benefit. The rewards also need to seem achievable for customers to desire them. In our scenario, one of the considerations is that the food truck owners are open to rewards systems. The article outlines important things to keep in mind while developing a reward system in the modern world. 
	</br>
	<b>Use:</b>	In our solution, we will employ many of the ideas set forth by this article. One useful tip it provides is to differentiate the reward system from other similar ones to drive customer interest. By using creative brainstorming in the development of our reward system, we can make it fun and unique. Our idea to create a reward system for sharing the location/photos of the food truck is also considered good marketing by the ideas set forth in this article. By offering reward for sharing about the truck, current customers are kept engaged and new customers may be reached through posts. A meld of the reward system and technology will prove a potent solution for the food truck scenario.

	<b>Source:</b> Myrick, R. <i>Developing Your Food Truck Social Media Strategy</i> </br>
	<b>Summary:</b> In “Developing Your Food Truck Social Media Strategy, Richard Myrick provides a basic framework of questions that food truck owners should ask themselves when embarking on the journey to market via social media. He first explains the invaluable nature of social media marketing for food truck owners and proposes that a successful strategy requires more effort than simply having the social media accounts.
	</br>
	<b>Use:</b>	Determining to whom, about what, where and how your social media marketing relies on an overarching goal for the task. In our food truck scenario, we will utilize the framework laid out by Myrick to define focal points, outline answers, and provide direction to our solution.

	<b>Source:</b> Derby, K.L. <i>Social Media: Multiple Channels to Capture Multiple Audiences</i></br>
	<b>Summary:</b> This paper expands upon the different target demographics of various social media applications. It explains that the audiences of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest, and Vine differ based on age, interest, and purpose of the user. The paper continues to describe how different engagement campaigns and analyses of users are implemented to ensure the user base of varying social media applications. The article was written to assist institutions in reaching alumni, students, and potential students. 
	</br>
	<b>Use:</b>	From this article, we are able to gleam some understanding of the different user demographics of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram in order to focus our solution. The article eplains the usefulness of Instagram and twitter in connecting to younger users as well as the usefulness of Facebook in connecting to older users.
