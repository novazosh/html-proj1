<h3> The Problem </h3>
A new food truck has just opened in town and the owner is looking for a way to stay connected with their growing customer base as well as engage new customers. The owners arenâ€™t up-to-date on technology trends and has two other employees besides themselves.
<h3> Background </h3>
One of the largest hurdles for a food truck is simply attracting customers, especially when first starting off. Location is extremely variable and times of operation fluctuate depending on day to day variables such as weather and traffic. How do customers know when their favorite food truck is open? How do they know where it is? 
<h3> Why this Problem? </h3>
We came together as a group hoping to choose a problem that affected a large and dynamic consumer base. Food trucks claim an interestesting marketing space which demands sleek social media strategies that appeal to widely varying customers.
<h3> How we Solved the Problem </h3>
We noted that location and customer engagement were two of the largest challenges for a food truck. With this in mind we decided to employ a mobile platform that would allow customers to have a direct line of contact with the food trucks. To solve the issue of location we wanted a platform where the location of the food truck could be posted, updated and available to a large range of customers. We decided that a mobile platform would work as well to retain customers, issuing rewards and detailing deals in the form of mobile notifications. Ultimately we created a mobile app to disclose food truck location and engage customers in a tech savvy way.
